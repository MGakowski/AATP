# AATP - ASCII Art To Python
Converts a text file of ASCII art into lines of print code for Python to create a banner or splashs screen for your python code. Compatible with Python 2 &amp; 3. I made this to save time on pre/suffixing python code to banners or a splash.

## How to Use
1. Create a txt file of ASCII art and save it in script directory. Make your own or use online services ([Text to ASCII](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20))
2. Run script and follow prompts.
  * The script will ask if you want to make a new file or override the art file.
  * It will ask you what version of Python you want the code compatible with(2xx or 3xx).
  * It will ask for the name of the art file.
